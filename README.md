# JFprofessionalportfolio

To View the deployed version of my portfolio, please use the following link: https://jerryforsberg.github.io/JFprofessionalportfolio/.

This portfolio was built using html, css and bootstrap. The pages contained in this app are the about me(home) page, a portfolio page with some examples of my previous work, and a contact page with several ways to reach me. 

This portfolio is a work in progress and, will be continually refined in the coming moths. 

Currently, the design is basic but clean and easy to read. 

Along with this, the site is responsive across all platforms. This was acheived using the bootstrap grid components. Please see screenshots of the portfolio page in a desktop browser format, as well as a mobile format, below.

Most of the formatting for this site was completed using bootstrap features, such as the navbar, the listgroup for the contact info, the media body for the portfolio page, the jumbotron for the about me page. Some of the styling that was changed was some spacing between elements, the font for the content, and some of the coloring, as well as image and paragraph sizing. 

I intend to have future versions of this portfolio be more interactive with more functionality and more javascript features.
