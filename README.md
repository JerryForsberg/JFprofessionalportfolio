# JFprofessionalportfolio

To View the deployed version of my portfolio, please use the following link: https://jerryforsberg.github.io/JFprofessionalportfolio/.

This portfolio was built using html, css and bootstrap. The pages contained in this app are the about me(home) page, a portfolio page with some examples of my previous work, and a contact page with several ways to reach me. 

This portfolio is a work in progress and, will be continually refined in the coming moths. 

Currently, the design is basic but clean and easy to read. 

Along with this, the site is responsive across all platforms. Please see screenshots of the portfolio page in a desktop browser format, as well as a mobile format, below.
